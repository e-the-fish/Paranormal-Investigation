    <h3>
       So, after that history lesson, we're finally ready to do some investigating. One of the main mysteries in the town is the Winn Graveyard.
       The Winn Graveyard has been part of the town since it was founded by Edgar Winn Jr. The graveyard has always had a reputation for being haunted
       and some say that Edgar's <span id="ghost-link" style="text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;">ghost</span>  still haunts the graveyard. So next post, we're gonna check out the Graveyard and see if we can find some clues 
       that help us figure out what is going on.
    </h3>

    <h3>
      We arrived at the Graveyard at 10AM and did a little investigating. We didnt find anything at first but after about an hour of looking, we found something 
      crazy, a dead cat! The poor thing had been strangled. Whatever, or whoever had done this had to be human, or at least humanoid. We looked around the area for 
      some time and found something even weirder: a torn up collar with "Tabby" written on it. That cat belonged to one of the missing people, [REDACTED]. This is a really
      big deal, maybe the same person who killed Tabby kidnapped her owner!
