               So, after that history lesson, we're finally ready to do some investigating. One of the main mysteries in the town is the Winn Graveyard.
               The Winn Graveyard has been part of the town since it was founded by Edgar Winn Jr. The graveyard has always had a reputation for being haunted
               and some say that Edgar's ghost still haunts the graveyard. So next post, we're gonna check out the Graveyard and see if we can find some clues 
               that help us figure out what is going on.
            </h3>
