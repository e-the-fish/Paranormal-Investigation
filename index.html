            <h3>
                Hey everyone this is our first post. I'm [REDACTED], and I'm with my friends [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. For those that dont know,
                we live in the town of Willowgrass, Maine and recently, some weird things have been going on. In the last 4 months, 11 people have disappeared, there have
                been many  people claiming that their houses are haunted, and Farmer Paul McGregor claims that his cows were taken by Aliens. So, we decided to make a Blog
                to <span id="investigate-link" style="text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;">investigate</span>  what the heck is going on in Willowgrass.
            </h3>              
            <h2>7/3/2003</h2>
            <h3>
                 Now that we've explained what we're doing, lets give you some more context on what's happened.
                 Firstly, as we already mentioned, there have been many unexplained disappearances. The Willowgrass 
                 County police have been searching everywhere to find them but with no luck. We can't disclose the names of them, but they all
                 went missing at around the same time. Another weird thing that happened is that three familys that have been living here just recently left,
                 claiming that their houses were haunted. We  did some research and one of the familys, The Robinson's house was the site of a famous murder. Maybe
                 the whole haunting thing wasn't just paranoia. Anyway, the murder was done in 1843, a rich family were killed by a servant who had gone insane. Sadly, 
                 we couldn't interview the Robinsons about their specific experience, but, its still a strange coincidence.
            </h3>

            <h3>
               So, after that history lesson, we're finally ready to do some investigating. One of the main mysteries in the town is the Winn Graveyard.
               The Winn Graveyard has been part of the town since it was founded by Edgar Winn Jr. The graveyard has always had a reputation for being haunted
               and some say that Edgar's ghost still haunts the graveyard. So next post, we're gonna check out the Graveyard and see if we can find some clues 
               that help us figure out what is going on.
